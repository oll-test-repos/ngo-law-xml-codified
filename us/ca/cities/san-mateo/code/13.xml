      <heading>Purpose and Intent</heading>
      <text><cite path="13.40">This Chapter</cite> is adopted because the City has been forested with a variety of healthy and valuable trees which must be protected, preserved, and replenished for the health and welfare of residents and in order to preserve scenic beauty, maintain property values, prevent erosion, protect against flood hazards and landslides, counteract pollutants in the air, maintain climatic balance, decrease wind velocities, and relieve the public costs of installing and maintaining stormwater drainage systems. It is the intent of <cite path="13.40">this chapter</cite> to establish regulations for the protection of trees within the City in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with these purposes and the reasonable economic enjoyment of private property.</text>
